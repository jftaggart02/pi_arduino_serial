Stage 1 of testing:

Wait for button to be pressed
Read potentiometer voltage
Map to value between 0 and 255
Send potentiometer value to pi over serial


Stage 2 of testing:

Wait for button to be pressed
Read potentiometer voltage
Map to value between 0 and 255
Send potentiometer value to pi over serial
Wait for pi to send back that value
Write that value to LED


Stage 3 of testing:

Loop forever

	Read potentiometer 1
	Send 2 bytes: number 1 and mapped potentiometer value
	
	Read potentiometer 2
	Send 2 bytes: number 1 and mapped potentiometer value
	
	If there are at least 2 bytes in input buffer,
		
		Read 2 bytes.
		
		Map 2nd byte to value from 0 to 1023.
		
		If first is number 3,
		
			Write analog value to LED 1
			
		Else if first is number 4,
		
			Write analog value to LED 2
			
		Endif
	
	Endif
