What I found out by running this program:
- When you upload it to the Arduino and look at the serial monitor, it doesn't read anything.
- When you change every instance of "Serial1" to "Serial", upload it to the Arduino, and look
at the serial monitor, it reads what the Arduino is printing.
- What I learned from this is only Serial sends data through the USB cable. The other objects,
Serial1, Serial2, and Serial3, only send data through the Rx and Tx pins that aren't pins 1 
and 0.
