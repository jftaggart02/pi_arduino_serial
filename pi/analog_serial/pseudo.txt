Stage 1 of testing:

Wait for byte to appear in input buffer
Print "I read " + value


Stage 2 of testing:

Wait for byte to appear in input buffer
Print "I read " + value
Send value to arduino


Stage 3 of testing:

Loop forever

	If there are at least 2 bytes in input buffer, 
	
		Read 2 bytes.
		
		If the first byte is the number 1,
		
			Send back the number 3.
			
			Send back 2nd byte received.
			
		Else if the first byte is the number 2,
		
			Send back the number 4.
			
			Send back 2nd byte received.
			
		Endif
