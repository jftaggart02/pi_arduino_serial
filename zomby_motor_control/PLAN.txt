Computer code:
1. import serial library
2. begin serial communication with Arduino
3. wait for arduino to indicate that it's ready
4. send continuous stream of motor commands to make the motors spin up slowly and spin down
slowly.

Arduino code:

void loop () {

    Get RC switch value;

    If (switch == on)
        // RC Logic

    Else {

        if there are 2 bytes in input buffer
            desired = serial message;
        else
            desired = 0;

        If (speed < desired)
            speed ++;
        Else If (speed > desired)
            speed --;
        write motors to speed;
        Delay 10 ms;

    }

}
