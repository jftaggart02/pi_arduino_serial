Pseudocode for program that allows arduino and raspberry pi to send and receive analog values 


For Arduino:


Stage 1 of testing:

Wait for button to be pressed
Read potentiometer voltage
Map to value between 0 and 255
Send potentiometer value to pi over serial


Stage 2 of testing:

Wait for button to be pressed
Read potentiometer voltage
Map to value between 0 and 255
Send potentiometer value to pi over serial
Wait for pi to send back that value
Write that value to LED


Stage 3 of testing:

Loop forever

	Read potentiometer 1
	Send 2 bytes: number 1 and mapped potentiometer value
	
	Read potentiometer 2
	Send 2 bytes: number 1 and mapped potentiometer value
	
	If there are at least 2 bytes in input buffer,
		
		Read 2 bytes.
		
		Map 2nd byte to value from 0 to 1023.
		
		If first is number 3,
		
			Write analog value to LED 1
			
		Else if first is number 4,
		
			Write analog value to LED 2
			
		Endif
	
	Endif
	
Endloop


For Raspberry Pi:


Stage 1 of testing:

Wait for byte to appear in input buffer
Print "I read " + value


Stage 2 of testing:

Wait for byte to appear in input buffer
Print "I read " + value
Send value to arduino


Stage 3 of testing:

Loop forever

        If there are at least 2 bytes in input buffer,

                Read 2 bytes.

                If the first byte is the number 1,

                        Send back the number 3.

                        Send back 2nd byte received.

                Else if the first byte is the number 2,

                        Send back the number 4.

                        Send back 2nd byte received.

                Endif

Endloop
